### House Price Regression
This project aims to predict house prices using various regression models. The dataset used is from Kaggle's House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The models evaluated include Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Support Vector Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors Regression, and Decision Tree Regression.

### Project Overview
Overfitting and underfitting are common challenges in machine learning. This project demonstrates how different regression models handle these challenges and compares their performance on the house price dataset.

### Dataset
The dataset contains 1460 observations of 80 features, including numerical and categorical data. The target variable is SalePrice.

### Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- k-Nearest Neighbors Regression (kNN)
- Decision Tree Regression
  
### Evaluation Metrics
- R2 Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### Results
The performance of the models is evaluated based on the test dataset. The Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models achieved the highest R2 scores and the lowest error values, indicating better generalization.

### Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
